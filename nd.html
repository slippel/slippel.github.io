									<p class="new_paragraph2"><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic17.jpg" alt="bottom"></span>Steffi Lippel, MScN, a nutritionist who loves to cook and teach others how to make delicious and nutritious food, has always sought ways to make a positive impact on people’s lives.
									She received her BA in Sustainable Community Development in 2007 from the University of Arizona in Tucson, and graduated in 2017 with her Masters of Science in Nutrition from the National University of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon.
									Her other adventures include tending an abandoned lot garden in West Philly, planting and educating others on the art of creating edible gardens, and preparing yummy meals from gleaned food for homeless youth. Steffi realizes how critical good nutrition and a postive relationship with food are to one’s well-being through her own struggles with depression, anxiety, and discovering, then pursuing, her purpose. She is excited to share her passion for helping people find their best approach to diet and lifestyle according to their own unique needs and preferences.
									While taking the time to develop a regular meditation practice, Steffi also enjoys going on hikes with her lovable mutt, Akira, and has recently picked up weight lifting. She lives in Portland, Oregon.</p>
